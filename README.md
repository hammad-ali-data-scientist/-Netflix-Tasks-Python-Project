# Netflix Tasks – Python Project

## 📌 Overview
This project includes a series of tasks performed using Python on a Netflix dataset. The aim is to practice data analysis, data wrangling, and filtering techniques using Python and Pandas.

Each task demonstrates operations such as:
- Data filtering
- Date-time operations
- Conditional queries
- String operations
- Grouping and aggregation

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
